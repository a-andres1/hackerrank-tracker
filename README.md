# hackerrank-tracker

a tracker to track my rank on hackerrank.com

## Purpose

I wanted to throw together a little html tonight to just get back into the swing of things. I don't know if I'll be able to make this dynamic, but I will try. Perhaps it will be good practice to update it every day or so. 

### Plans
- To make the website dynamic
- To make it look nice using a CSS framework, maybe I'll use skeleton and play with it a bit more for this one. 
- To get my hackerrank to be better than 2 million.
